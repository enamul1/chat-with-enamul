My name is Mohammad Enamul Haque. I'm an sr. software engineer and etoro popular investor. I'm originally from Bangladesh, but I moved to Germany in 2021.
I love all foods, particularly Kebap and curry würst. I like to take responsibility, solve problem and provide resulsts.

My etoro Bio is as follows:

My investment strategy:

1. Create a small pool of companies I know outside of etoro.
2. Analyse their past records for at least 3 years.
3. Analyse their growth potential.
4. Read what news and other experts are talking about them.

Then I finally invest.

I wish to keep it simple, easy, and transparent. I will never obfuscate facts or misrepresent them. If I make a loss, I will accept it as a loss.

I will almost always maintain a long a.k.a buy portfolio. I also plan to keep most positions to keep open for years. e.g. Paypal, Amazon, Google, Pfizer, etc.

I try to regularly add money and I would suggest my copiers to do the same to make a sizeable wealth in the long term. This also help to DCA and reduce risk.

I am a platinum club member, which means my current portfolio value is between 25000$ and 50000$

How Much Should One Invest? 💰

I see many people talking about the rule: "Invest first, then spend."

Recently, I saw a sad news story about a person who passed away in Canada. They had a lot of money saved up in their investment portfolio. This story really made me think, and honestly, I am not a big fan of this extreme way of thinking.
If investing a lot makes you truly happy, then that's great! Go for it! But if it means you live in constant financial stress or you can't enjoy your life today, then it's a big NO from me.

Your present life is very important, just like your future, or maybe even more! You must try to enjoy it, too.

I am not saying you should live a luxurious or very expensive lifestyle.
I am talking about living a comfortable life. You should be able to enjoy simple things and have peace of mind.

I even saw another Popular Investor bragging that they invest first, and then they buy food. 🤯 Please, do not do this! Take care of your basic needs first.

𝐈'𝐦 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐩𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐲:

𝐈 𝐁𝐮𝐲 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. I only invest in great companies that I believe will succeed over the long term. Even if their price is falling now (a correction), I'm confident they'll grow eventually.

𝐌𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠. My portfolio is already up 22% Year-to-Date (YTD)! This strong performance means the recent dips in November and March haven't hurt my overall results much.

I'm staying focused on the fundamentals and the long game. Who else is ignoring the short-term noise?

𝐖𝐡𝐲 $GOOGL (Alphabet Inc Class A) 𝐢𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐈 𝐄𝐫𝐚
To understand Google's future, we must look beyond its current success in search and advertising. The company is building a powerful, interconnected system designed for leadership in the age of AI. This strategy rests on three key pillars: a fortress of dominant platforms, a high-growth cloud business, and a superior AI that enhances everything.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬: 𝐔𝐧𝐛𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞
Google's foundation is its collection of world-leading platforms. $GOOG (Alphabet) Search still commands over 90% of the global search market, Android OS runs on over 72% of the world's smartphones, and YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users. These platforms are more than just profitable; they are the world's largest data-gathering engine. The massive amount of data from searches, video views, and mobile usage is the essential fuel for training Google's AI models like Gemini. This creates a powerful cycle: more data leads to smarter AI, which is then used to improve the products. Better products attract more users, which generates even more data. This self-reinforcing loop gives Alphabet an "AI Moat" that competitors struggle to match.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞: 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝
While the core businesses provide stability, Google Cloud is the company's key growth driver. The cloud computing market is rapidly expanding, driven by the intense demand for AI services. In this critical market, Google Cloud is gaining momentum. In the second quarter of 2025, its revenue grew by an impressive 32%, significantly outpacing the market leader, Amazon Web Services. This shows that companies are increasingly choosing Google Cloud for their most important new AI projects.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐩𝐬
AI is the universal layer connecting all parts of Alphabet's strategy. The company's advanced Gemini AI is being deeply integrated into every major product, from AI Overviews in Search to new capabilities on Android phones. This makes every service smarter and more indispensable to users.

Beyond today's AI, Alphabet is investing in the next generation of technology. In a landmark achievement, its "Willow" quantum processor solved a complex problem 13,000 times faster than the world's most powerful supercomputer. This breakthrough in quantum computing could lead to revolutionary discoveries in medicine and materials science, securing Alphabet's technological leadership for decades to come.

𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐕𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬, 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐋𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐑𝐢𝐬𝐤
Alphabet is also successfully turning its long-term research projects into real businesses. Its self-driving car unit, Waymo, is now a large-scale commercial service, providing over 250,000 paid autonomous trips every week and expanding to new cities in the U.S. and internationally.

This strategy is supported by excellent financial performance, with revenues recently growing 14% to $96.4 billion in a single quarter. Furthermore, a major risk for investors has been significantly reduced. For years, the threat of a government-forced breakup loomed over the company. However, recent landmark antitrust rulings have rejected this possibility, leaving the company's core structure and synergistic advantages intact.

With its dominant businesses secure, its growth engines accelerating, its technological superiority established, and its primary legal threats resolved, Alphabet is in an incredibly strong position to become the undisputed technology leader for the next decade.

𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐂𝐨𝐩𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 "𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬" 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐨! 🚫

I see many people follow the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, thinking they are following Bill Gates.

Most public lists you see online are actually the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. This is charity money, not Bill’s personal wallet.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞:

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐏𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜): This portfolio is designed to be safe so it can fund charity work. It holds defensive stocks like $WM (Waste Management Inc) and $BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway Inc) They are required by law to publish this list every quarter.

𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥’𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 (𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞): His actual wealth is managed by a private company called Cascade Investment. This portfolio is not public. It includes assets you cannot easily buy, like private tech startups, the Four Seasons hotels, and massive amounts of U.S. farmland.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: We only see Bill’s personal stocks if he owns a huge chunk (more than 5%) of a company. The rest is hidden.

If you track the "Gates Portfolio", you are most likely tracking a conservative charity strategy, not necessarily the high-growth bets of Bill Gates himself.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 "𝐁𝐮𝐛𝐛𝐥𝐞" 𝐌𝐲𝐭𝐡: 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧 $GOOGL (Alphabet Inc Class A)

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: Tech stocks are expensive and in a bubble. Meanwhile, companies like $SBUX (Starbucks Corp) are seen as stable, reasonably priced consumer staples.

But when you use fundamental valuation looking at what you pay for a company's profits (P/E) the reality is flipped!

𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞-𝐭𝐨-𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 (𝐏/𝐄) 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨
This metric tells you how many dollars you pay for every $1 of the company's annual profit.

$SBUX P/E ratio = 52.03 (Source: Etoro) , HIGH PREMIUM. You pay up to $52 for $1 of profit. This prices in massive future growth, which SBUX is currently struggling to deliver

$GOOG (Alphabet) P/E ratio = 27.32 (Source: Etoro), you pay approximately $27 for $1 of profit. For a company with Google's dominance, growth, and cash flow, this is relatively cheap.

I am unable to understand on which situation Starbucks can grow faster than Google.

In my opinion, in the coming days, $TSLA (Tesla Motors, Inc.) will face growing competition from other robotics companies. I don’t think they’ll get the same free run with humanoid robots that they had with EVs in the early years.

I’ve always wondered why some investors buy $MSTR (Strategy Inc) instead of BTC, especially long-term investors.

A few things make me think buying $BTC is almost always better for long-term investors, especially in 𝐆𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲:

𝐓𝐚𝐱 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬: If you hold BTC for one year, it's tax-free. With MSTR, you pay 25% tax, which is a big difference.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐮𝐦 𝐈𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞: MSTR often trades at a large premium to the actual market value of the Bitcoin it holds (its Net Asset Value). You might end up paying $1.50 or even $2.00 for every $1.00 of Bitcoin the company owns.

𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐑𝐢𝐬𝐤: You're not just exposed to Bitcoin only, you’re also exposed to MicroStrategy as a company. That includes management risk, debt risk, and operational risk.

The only real advantage is the leveraged exposure to Bitcoin, but that cuts both ways.
