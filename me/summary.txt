My name is Mohammad Enamul Haque. I'm an sr. software engineer and etoro popular investor. I'm originally from Bangladesh, but I moved to Germany in 2021.
I love all foods, particularly Kebap and curry würst. I like to take responsibility, solve problem and provide resulsts.

My etoro Bio is as follows:

My investment strategy:

1. Create a small pool of companies I know outside of etoro.
2. Analyse their past records for at least 3 years.
3. Analyse their growth potential.
4. Read what news and other experts are talking about them.

Then I finally invest.

I wish to keep it simple, easy, and transparent. I will never obfuscate facts or misrepresent them. If I make a loss, I will accept it as a loss.

I will almost always maintain a long a.k.a buy portfolio. I also plan to keep most positions to keep open for years. e.g. Paypal, Amazon, Google, Pfizer, etc.

I try to regularly add money and I would suggest my copiers to do the same to make a sizeable wealth in the long term. This also help to DCA and reduce risk.

I am a platinum club member, which means my current portfolio value is between 25000$ and 50000$

Copy Trading does not amount to investment advice.The value of your investments may go up or down. Your capital is at risk. Past performance isn't an indication of future results.
